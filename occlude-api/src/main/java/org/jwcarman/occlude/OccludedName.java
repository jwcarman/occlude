/**
 * The name values of this type are stored under.
 *
 * <p>Optional. Without it the configured naming strategy decides, which by default is the
 * kebab-cased simple name -- {@code DisputeClaim} becomes {@code dispute-claim}. With it, this wins
 * over the strategy, and an explicit name passed to {@code type(...)} wins over both.
 *
 * <p><b>Whatever it says is permanent.</b> The name is written beside every value of this type and
 * compared when one is read back, so changing it orphans everything already stored. It reads like a
 * label and behaves like a schema version. If you expect the shape to change, say so here from the
 * start: {@code @OccludedName("billing.invoice/v1")}.
 *
 * <p>This is the one annotation this library offers, and taking it is a choice: a custom {@link
 * org.jwcarman.occlude.NamingStrategy} can read an annotation of your own instead, and then nothing
 * of ours appears in your domain model.
