 * The authority to make one new held value from any number of existing ones, all of the same type.
 *
 * <p>Many parents, one type, and the number is whatever arrived: summarising a mail thread,
 * totalling a set of invoices, folding retrieved passages into one context.
 *
 * <p>This split is not invented here. {@code kotlinx.coroutines} gives {@code Flow.combine}
 * heterogeneous overloads for two through five flows and a {@code vararg} overload for many of one
 * type; RxJava's {@code zip} and Reactor's {@code zip} do the same. Every one of them stops at a
 * fixed arity for the same reason this does: the JVM has no variadic generics.
 *
 * <p>Reading many values needs no equivalent, and deliberately has none. In a semilattice {@code a
 * ⊔ b ⊑ c} holds exactly when {@code a ⊑ c} and {@code b ⊑ c}, so five values that each passed a
 * sink's ceiling are proof the combination passes. A fold exists only because a <i>derived</i>
 * value's joined label has to be stored and carried forward.
