/**
 * The authority to make one new held value from one existing one.
 *
 * <p>The ordinary case, and the overwhelming majority: pulling a field out of a record, formatting,
 * normalising, truncating. {@link Fold} covers many parents of one type.
 *
 * <p>There is deliberately no fixed-arity form for parents of <i>different</i> types. One was
 * built, up to five, and nothing ever used it -- not the example, not a test, not even the
 * two-parent case. When a real one turns up it can be added for the arity it actually needs.
 *
 * <p>Plaintext is read in order to compute and does not leave. The result carries its parent's
 * label unless the derivation was declared with a lowering rule, and a lowering is checked against
 * the lattice: relabelling to something not below the parent is refused, because raising is what
 * ordinary derivation already does and declaring it here is a mistake worth naming.
 *
 * <p>Minted during configuration, and obtainable only by being handed one.
