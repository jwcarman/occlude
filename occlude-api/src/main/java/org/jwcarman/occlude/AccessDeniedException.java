/**
 * A store refused.
 *
 * <p>One exception for every gate, so a caller that wants to turn refusals into a 403 writes one
 * handler rather than discovering the second type in production. There were two of these, and the
 * example's controller caught one of them: a refused derivation -- the wrong tenant, not an
 * approver -- came back as a 500, and a test asserted that as though it were the intent.
 *
 * <p>The reason is a name rather than an enum because the gates refuse for different reasons and a
 * caller handling all of them wants a string to log, not a switch over a union.
