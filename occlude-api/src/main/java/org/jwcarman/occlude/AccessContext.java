/**
 * What the application knows about whoever is asking, at the moment they ask.
 *
 * <p><b>A charter never interprets this.</b> There is no principal, no role and no identity concept
 * in this library -- only a bag of strings an application fills in and its own ceiling functions
 * read. An application with no notion of identity contributes nothing and every sink ignores it.
 *
 * <p>It exists because of one case: a sink that is a <em>person</em>. Two approvers looking at the
 * same record are not necessarily entitled to see the same thing. Machine sinks almost always
 * ignore the context entirely -- a payment processor accepts cardholder data or it does not,
 * whoever asked.
 *
 * <p>It is also what an audit line records, which is the other reason it cannot be skipped.
