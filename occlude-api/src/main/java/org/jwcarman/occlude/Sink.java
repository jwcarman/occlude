 * Somewhere values may go, and the only thing that constitutes a reader for it.
 *
 * <p>A sink is a subsystem -- a payment processor, a shipping service, a vendor model -- together
 * with both restrictions on reaching it. The ceiling says which labels may arrive; the declared
 * types say what it reads. Both are settled when it is declared and neither can be widened
 * afterwards.
 *
 * <p>Which is what makes a reader a view rather than a grant. {@link #reading} adds no authority:
 * it enforces the ceiling that was already there, and refuses a type that was not declared. So a
 * reader can be constituted where it is needed and thrown away, and <b>a sink is safe to hand to
 * the service that talks to that subsystem</b>. It holds no configuration and cannot declare a new
 * door -- only look through this one.
 *
 * <p>It is still more authority than any one reader, because it can constitute a reader for every
 * type it was declared to read. Hand out the sink when a service talks to the whole subsystem; hand
 * out a reader when it needs one kind of value.
