/**
 * A type this store keeps, and the name it is kept under.
 *
 * <p>Two things that must agree, carried together so they cannot drift. The Java type says how to
 * decode a value; the name is what gets written beside it and compared on the way out.
 *
 * <p><b>The name is not the class name</b>, and that is the point. A stored name is permanent: it
 * is on every row already written, so it has to survive the refactors a class does not. Rename the
 * record, move it to another package, split the module -- the name stays and everything already
 * stored is still readable. Change the name and you have orphaned every row carrying the old one,
 * which is a migration and not a preference.
 *
 * <p>Declare one wherever it reads best: {@code type(...)} on the configuration applies the naming
 * strategy for you, and this constructor is fine when you would rather say it plainly. Either way
 * the configuration sees every type that reaches a portal and refuses two of them wanting one name,
 * so the check does not depend on which you chose.
 *
 * <p>Holding one grants nothing -- it names a type, it does not open a door -- and a mismatched
 * pairing gains nothing either. A reader still only reaches names its sink declared and its store
 * recorded, so the worst a wrong pairing does is fail to decode something you could already read.
 *
 * @param name what values of this type are written down as
 * @param type how to decode one
 * @param <T> the Java type
