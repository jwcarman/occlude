 * looks like, and the two readings are opposites: a value whose tenant nobody set is not private to
 * nobody, it is readable by everybody, because bottom sits below every ceiling.
 *
 * <p>This was measured before the axis could be marked. A request arriving with no tenant header
 * wrote a value labelled {@code none}, and both acme and globex could read it. The natural thing to
 * write -- {@code orElseGet(Exact::none)} for a missing tenant -- was the leak.
