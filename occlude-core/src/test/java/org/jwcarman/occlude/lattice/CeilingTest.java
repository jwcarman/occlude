 * <p>Which is the whole point of the redesign. As a single point in the lattice it could not
 * express the reporting job below -- entitled to every tenant, but still only endorsed and still
 * only ordinary -- so the library offered a way to turn the check off instead, buying breadth on
 * one axis by surrendering all three. The last two tests here are the ones that could not be
