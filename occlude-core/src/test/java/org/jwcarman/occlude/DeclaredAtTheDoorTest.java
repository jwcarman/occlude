/**
 * A sink settles both its restrictions when it is declared.
 *
 * <p>The ceiling says which labels may reach it and the type list says what it reads. Neither can
 * be widened afterwards, and that is what makes a reader safe to hand out and safe to throw away: a
 * reader is a typed view of a door, not a grant of anything the door did not already have.
 *
 * <p>Which in turn is what makes the sink itself handable. Give a service the door to the subsystem
 * it talks to and let it take whatever readers it needs. It holds no configuration, so it cannot
 * declare a new door -- only look through this one.
