/**
 * Every gate in this library is application code, and application code throws.
 *
 * <p>A ceiling reads a tenant id out of a context that turns out to be empty; a lowering rule
 * consults a table that is not there yet. What matters is what the store does about it, because the
 * two available behaviours are not equally safe: a policy that cannot be evaluated has not said
 * yes, and an exception that escapes leaves the operation with no audit line at all.
 *
 * <p>The last case is the sharp one. A derivation receives plaintext in order to compute. If it
 * fails <i>after</i> reading it, the read happened, and the record has to say so.
