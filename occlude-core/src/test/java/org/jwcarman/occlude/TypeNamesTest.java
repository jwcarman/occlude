/**
 * A stored name has to identify one type.

 * <p>The name is what gets written beside a value and compared when one is read back. Two types
 * sharing a name means a reader is handed the wrong one, and the failure surfaces as a decode error
 * somewhere far from the cause. Finding it at startup is the whole point.
 *
 * <p>The check lives at the point of use rather than at construction, so it applies however the
 * type was declared -- by the configuration, or written out by hand.
