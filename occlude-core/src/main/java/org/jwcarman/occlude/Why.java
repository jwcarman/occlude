/**
 * Why a line in the trail says what it says.
 *
 * <p>Two halves of one answer, kept together because they are stored differently and must not be
 * confused. The <b>code</b> goes to disk in the clear, so that "how many refusals above a ceiling
 * this hour" is a question the trail can answer without decrypting anything. The <b>detail</b> --
 * which label, against which ceiling -- is label-shaped, so it is protected exactly like a label
 * is.
 *
 * <p>They travel as one value rather than as two adjacent string parameters. The alternative was an
 * eight-argument call with {@code null, null} in the middle of it, where putting an explanation in
 * the queryable column would describe every value in the system to anyone who could read the table,
 * and nothing would have complained.
 *
 * @param code names a rule, never a value
 * @param detail names a value, so it is never in the clear
