/**
 * Everything the engine needs to run a derivation, flattened to one arity-blind shape.
 *
 * <p>Package-private, and deliberately so. Arity is a property of the capability the application
 * holds, not of the machinery: a {@link Derivation} guarantees one parent of the right type and a
 * {@link Fold} guarantees many of one type, so what arrives here is a list whose length and element
 * types were already settled by the compiler. That is why {@code function} can take {@code
 * List<Object>} without it being a hole.
 *
 * @param inputTypes one per parent, positionally; for a fold, exactly one, applying to all of them
