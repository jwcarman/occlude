/**
 * What a charter permits, in a form a person can read.
 *
 * <p>Worth printing at startup and worth pasting into a review. No algebra can tell you whether a
 * check is strong enough -- an endorsement that merely confirms a record exists looks exactly like
 * one that ties it to the person who asked -- so the list being short, named and in front of
 * somebody is the control.
 *
 * <p>Two sections are what a reviewer came for. The <b>label-weakening operations</b>: everything
 * else in the design makes labels more constrained, these are the only things that can make them
 * less, and there should be few enough to read in one sitting.
 *
 * <p>And the <b>questions</b>. A question never hands the value over, which makes it look like the
 * safe way to use one -- but each answer is a bit and the asker chooses the question, so enough of
 * them read the value a piece at a time. Nothing here counts them, deliberately: a budget small
 * enough to stop reconstruction is small enough to make the feature useless, and what actually
 * distinguishes a probe from a question is the shape of what the caller may choose, which only the
 * person who wrote it knows. What limits the exposure is the ceiling -- a value you may not ask
 * about gives you no questions at all -- and what makes it visible is the trail, which records
 * every question against the value it was asked about.
 *
 * @param bottom how a label that says nothing renders
 * @param sources the doors values enter through
 * @param sinks the doors values leave through
 * @param derivations what makes one value from others
 * @param questions what asks one bit of a value without the value leaving
 * @param erasures what may forget a value and everything derived from it
 * @param inspections what may read a value's label and lineage
 * @param findings what can be proved wrong about the declarations without running anything
 * @param renderedFor the access the ceilings in this report were evaluated for
