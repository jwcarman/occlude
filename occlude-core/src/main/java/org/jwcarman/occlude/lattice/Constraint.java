 * point in the whole lattice, and a point cannot express "any tenant, but only endorsed, only
 * ordinary" -- the set of labels that satisfies it is not of the form "everything below some
 * value", so no value denotes it. The library's answer was to let a reader turn the check off
 * entirely, which bought breadth on one axis by giving up all three.

// S2326 says T is unused, and at runtime it is: Any carries no T, and erasure removes the parameter
// everywhere. T is here so a constraint and the axis it constrains have to agree while the code is
// being written -- a constraint on a tenant axis cannot be attached to an axis written in anything
// else, and Constraint.<Tenant>any() is still a tenant constraint although it holds no tenant.
// Erasing T would make every constraint assignable to every axis and move that mismatch to a
// ClassCastException inside a ceiling check at request time, which is the one place a policy
// decision must not fail.
