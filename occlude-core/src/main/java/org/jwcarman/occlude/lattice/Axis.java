/**
 * One independent question about a value: whose is it, do we believe it, how sensitive is it.
 *
 * <p>An axis is not a name bolted onto an order. It is a <i>kind</i>, and the kind knows its own
 * rules -- how two values combine, and what breadth means on it. A ladder and a tenant behave
 * differently in ways no general-purpose order can express, which is why {@link #matching} exists
 * rather than an application assembling one out of parts.
 *
 * <p><b>Typed in what an application writes, not in what the engine stores.</b> {@code
 * Axis<String>} for a tenant means an application says {@code "acme"}. What the engine keeps is
 * wider than that -- it also has to represent "nobody said" and "two tenants were mixed", and
 * neither of those is a {@code String}. So {@code T} appears only on the way in, at {@link
 * #lift(Object)}, and everything past that point is opaque.
 *
 * <p>That asymmetry is what keeps this whole area free of unchecked casts. A typed container
 * normally needs one to hand {@code T} back out; nothing here ever hands {@code T} back out,
 * because nothing reads a label component. Labels are built, combined and rendered.
 *
 * @param <T> what an application writes on this axis
