/**
 * The questions an application asks about every value it holds.
 *
 * <p>The schema, and a value in its own right. A {@link Label} can only speak to an axis named
 * here, a {@link Ceiling} has to constrain every axis a label speaks to, and a stored row naming an
 * axis this no longer contains is refused rather than quietly read without it.
 *
 * <p>A type rather than a loose {@code List<Axis<?>>} for three reasons. The uniqueness rule
 * belongs to the set and not to whatever happens to hold it. Storage needs the same object to
 * decode a label against, so passing it around by name keeps one source of truth. And an
 * application can hand its vocabulary to infrastructure before anything is built from it, which is
 * what lets the thing that constructs a charter be the thing that brings it into force.
 *
 * <p>Ordered, because the order is what a manifest and an error message print.
