/**
 * What is known about one value, one axis at a time.
 *
 * <p>Built, combined and rendered. <b>Never read back.</b> There is no way to ask a label what it
 * says on an axis, and that absence is deliberate rather than an oversight: of the eight
 * declassification rules in this repository when the design was written, seven only ever wrote a
 * new value and the eighth read two components purely to copy them forward. Nothing needed a
 * getter.
 *
 * <p>Not having one is worth more than the convenience it would cost. A typed getter would have to
 * answer what a matching axis returns when it holds a mixture -- not the application's type,
 * because a mixture is not one, and not an empty optional either, because that would mean both
 * "mixed" and "nobody said" and those two must never be confused. Not having the getter means not
 * having the question, and it keeps labels opaque to application code, which is where the rest of
 * this library already stands.
 *
 * <p>Immutable. Every operation returns a new one.
