/**
 * A value that has to match exactly, and what happens when two of them do not.
 *
 * <p>Two tenants are not one more constrained than the other; they are incomparable. So combining
 * them cannot pick a winner, and refusing is not an option either -- a combine that can fail makes
 * the whole algebra partial, and it tells you at the wrong moment, while combining rather than when
 * someone tries to use the result.
 *
 * <p>So the mixture is a <i>value</i>. It sits above every single value, no ceiling admits it, and
 * a mixed thing exists with honest lineage to both parents while being incapable of reaching any
 * sink. Cross-tenant leakage is not forbidden by a rule someone remembered to write; the value that
 * would carry it is born unusable.
 *
 * <p><b>Only this class can make one.</b> An application writes {@code "acme"} and gets a single
 * value; there is no public constructor anywhere that produces a mixture. It arises only from
 * {@link #join}, inside the engine, which is what turns "no ceiling admits a mixture" from a
 * convention into a fact about what can be spoken.
