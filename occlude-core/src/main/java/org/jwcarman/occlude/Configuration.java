/**
 * Everything declared, frozen at the moment of sealing.
 *
 * <p>Built once rather than per declaration. Writing a charter is single-threaded -- it happens
 * while an application is being wired, before anything it constitutes can act -- so the collections
 * below are ordinary and mutable until they are copied in here.
 *
 * <p>What crosses threads is this, and it crosses exactly once: the atomic write that seals a
 * charter publishes it to every request thread that will ever use a portal. That is why it is
 * immutable and why the copies preserve order -- these are read back into the manifest and into the
 * refusal naming which types a door reads, and a message that differs between runs is a message
 * nobody trusts.
 *
 * <p>Top-level, and deliberately so. This record was nested in {@link DefaultCharter}, which made
 * the two mutually dependent: the engine took a {@code DefaultCharter.Configuration} and the
 * charter constructed the engine, so neither compiled without the other. Nothing here refers to the
 * charter, so the cycle was only ever a fact about where the declaration sat. Nesting it again
 * would restore the cycle.
