/**
 * Compression that cannot make things worse.
 *
 * <p><b>Measured, not assumed.</b> Most of what a store holds is small -- a card number, an account
 * record, an email address -- and a compressor's framing costs more than a short payload saves:
 *
 * <pre>
 * {"number":"4111111111114821","holder":"J CARMAN"}   49 bytes -> gzip 57   BIGGER
 * {"v":"4821"}                                        12 bytes -> gzip 32   BIGGER
 * an email body                                      851 bytes -> gzip 79   smaller
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>So compressing everything is wrong, and compressing nothing leaves the large values on the
 * table. This wraps any compressor, keeps its result only when it actually shrank, and marks which
 * it did with a leading byte. The worst case is one byte rather than a threefold expansion.
 *
 * <pre>{@code
 * Compression.whenItHelps(new GzipCodec())   // or ZstdCodec, or Lz4Codec
 * }</pre>
 *
 * <p>The marker byte and the stored length together say roughly how compressible a value was, which
 * is the shape of thing CRIME and BREACH exploit. It is a remote concern for data at rest with a
 * distinct key per value and no oracle to query -- and it is why labels are not compressed at all.
