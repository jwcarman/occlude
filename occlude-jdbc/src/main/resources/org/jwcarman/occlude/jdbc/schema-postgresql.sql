  -- changes the ciphertext and nothing that is signed. Destroying a key leaves these, so the graph
  -- still verifies even when what they commit to can no longer be read. A read decrypts and checks
  -- against them, so a ciphertext swapped in from elsewhere is refused rather than served.

  -- No timestamp. When a value was occluded is written down once, in occlude_audit, by the same
  -- transaction that writes this row -- one act, one time. A column here would be a second
  -- copy of that fact, disagreeing with it by however long the two clock reads were apart,
  -- and the trail's copy is the better one: chain-ordered, and it outlives erasure, which
  -- this table deliberately does not.
  -- What this value hashes to, over its own bytes and the digests of whatever it was made from.
  --
  -- Every fresh value starts its own graph: it has no parents, so it hashes from the root alone.
  -- Everything derived from it hashes from its parents, which are immutable and already written,
  -- so nothing has to be locked and two derivations never wait on each other. There is no global
  -- order here and none is needed -- a value is fixed by its ancestry, not by when it arrived.
  --
  -- Editing a value changes its digest, which breaks every descendant. Deleting one leaves its
  -- children hashing from something that is not there. Covering either up means recomputing the
  -- whole graph below it, which is exactly the work this makes necessary.
  --
  -- The root is where that stops being merely expensive. Rooted in a constant, somebody with write
  -- access can recompute a graph after editing it. Rooted in a secret the database does not hold,
  -- they cannot forge a single node.

  -- produce different digests.

-- erasure destroyed and nothing signed it, so deleting one of its rows left a value derived from
-- erased customer data alive with no verifier the wiser. This table is covered: a value hashes
-- from its parents, so rewriting who something was made from breaks that value and everything
-- below it. Computing reachability from the signed structure removes the trusted one rather than
-- adding a signature to it.

-- Deliberately NOT a child of occlude_value: no foreign key, no cascade. Erasing a customer removes
-- their values and everything derived from them, and the record that it happened has to survive
-- that, or the system cannot prove it did the thing it was legally required to do. The audit
-- outlives what it describes.
--
-- Most of this is in the clear, unlike occlude_value. An audit trail nobody can query is a tape
-- backup: answering "who touched this value", "what did this user do", "how many refusals in the
-- last hour" needs indexes on real columns. So `reason` holds the code alone -- it names a rule,
-- not a value, and stays queryable.
--
-- `detail` and `label` are the exceptions and are encrypted like the label on occlude_value, for the
-- same reason: they name a tenant, and in the clear they would describe every value in the system
-- to anyone who could read this table. `detail` is where a refusal says which label it turned away
-- and against which ceiling, which is exactly the thing a refusal must never tell its caller.

  -- delete a line, recompute the ones after it, and the chain agrees with itself again. Under an
  -- HMAC whose key this database does not hold, the ones after it cannot be recomputed, so a
  -- deletion leaves a break nobody can repair.
  --
  -- The cost is that appends are ordered -- each needs the digest of whatever came last, which is
  -- an advisory lock, not a table lock. Measured at about 180 appends a second from one writer and
