/**
 * What the audit chain costs, because a chain has to be appended to in order.
 *
 * <p>Every operation writes a line, and every line commits to the digest of the one before it, so
 * every operation takes the same lock. That is a ceiling on the whole system, and it was put there
 * without anybody measuring where it sits.
 *
 * <p>This does not assert a throughput number -- a number that fails on somebody's laptop is a
 * number nobody keeps. It asserts what has to be true whatever the hardware: under real contention,
 * every line is written and the chain is intact. The rate is reported so the ceiling is a known
 * quantity rather than an assumption.
