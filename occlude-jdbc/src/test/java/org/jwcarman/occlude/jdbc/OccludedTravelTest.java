/**
 * The claim this library makes most often: a reference can go anywhere, because holding one is not
 * permission to read it.
 *
 * <p>It only holds if the reference actually survives the journey. An {@code Occluded<T>} does not:
 * it carries a {@code TypeRef}, which no serialiser can reconstruct, and the type was never
 * authority anyway -- the gate checks it against what the store wrote. So what travels is the id,
 * and the receiving side says what it expects.
