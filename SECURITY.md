## What counts as a vulnerability here

Occlude exists to keep values from being disclosed, so a bug in it is often a security bug. The
following are vulnerabilities and are worth reporting privately:

- **Reading above a ceiling.** Any way to obtain plaintext that the declared ceiling should have
  refused, including through a derivation, a fold, a query or an erasure.
- **Forging a label.** Any way to make a value carry a label it was not occluded or derived at,
  or to weaken one without going through a declared lowering.
- **Obtaining a portal you were not handed.** Any lookup by name, reflection route, escaped
  reference, or use of a portal before its charter was sealed or after it should have been shut.
- **Defeating the record.** Any edit, deletion, reordering or replay of the audit trail, or of the
  value graph, that verification reports as intact.
- **Disclosure through a refusal.** A denial that reveals a value's type, contents or label to
  somebody whose ceiling would not have admitted it.
- **Cross-tenant leakage.** Anything that lets a value labelled for one tenant reach another,
  including through a mixture.

Some limits are known, documented, and not vulnerabilities:

- **Tail truncation.** Removing the most recent lines of the audit chain leaves a chain that
  verifies. Detecting it requires an anchor kept where the writer cannot reach it.
- **The query oracle.** A question answers one bit, and enough questions read a value a piece at a
  time. Nothing counts them; what limits the exposure is the ceiling.
- **Existence.** A refusal distinguishes an identifier that exists from one that does not.
- **What application code does with plaintext.** Occlude decides who may see a value. It cannot stop
  code that legitimately revealed one from writing it somewhere else.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, pull requests, or
discussions.**

Instead, please report via:
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: https://github.com/jwcarman/occlude/security/advisories/new (preferred)
- **Direct contact**: @jwcarman on GitHub

Include the following information:
- Detailed description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue, ideally as a failing test
- Potential impact assessment
- Any known workarounds or mitigations
- Whether the vulnerability is publicly known
- Affected versions (if known)
