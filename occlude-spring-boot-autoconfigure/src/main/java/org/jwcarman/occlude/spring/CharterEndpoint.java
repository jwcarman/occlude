/**
 * What this application's charter permits, explorable while it is running.
 *
 * <p>The manifest is already meant to be printed at startup and pasted into a review. This is the
 * same report reachable at runtime, which is where somebody asks the question that matters: not
 * "what did we intend to deploy" but "what is deployed".
 *
 * <pre>
 * /actuator/charter                      everything, plus what can be drilled into
 * /actuator/charter/types                every occluded type this charter mentions
 * /actuator/charter/types/{name}         everything declared about values of that type
 * /actuator/charter/sources/{name}       one door in
 * /actuator/charter/sinks/{name}  one door out
 * /actuator/charter/derivations/{name}   one way of making a value from another
 * /actuator/charter/questions/{name}     one question
 * /actuator/charter/findings             what is provably unreachable
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p><b>Declarations only, never a value.</b> Every name here was chosen by whoever wrote the
 * charter, and nothing is derived from anything held: no label, no lineage, no identifier of
 * anything occluded. That is the same line the {@link Charter} interface draws, and it is what
 * makes this safe to expose at all.
 *
 * <p><b>No evaluated ceilings.</b> A ceiling reads the access, and the access here belongs to
 * whoever is looking at an operations endpoint rather than to the caller a door was declared for.
 * Rendering them would produce a page of "could not decide", or worse, one tenant's limits shown to
 * somebody else. What is reported instead is what does not vary.
 *
 * <p>Still worth protecting. A list of every door and every declassification is a map of the
 * application's security posture, useful to somebody attacking it even though it discloses no data.
 * Treat it as you would {@code /actuator/beans}.
