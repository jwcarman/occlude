/**
 * A store kept in a database, wired when that module is on the classpath.
 *
 * <p>Takes the lifecycle off the application. Building a store is the moment its access space is
 * fixed: every capability declared beforehand is attached, and anything declared afterwards reaches
 * nothing. So the build must come last, after every bean that declares a portal has been
 * constructed -- which by hand means one class orchestrating the whole startup.
 *
 * <p>Here it is Spring's job. Declare a {@link JdbcStorageConfig} bean saying what your application
 * allows, take it as a parameter wherever you declare portals, and this supplies the plumbing and
 * builds the store once the context has finished making singletons.
 *
 * <p>Everything it supplies is {@link ConditionalOnMissingBean}, so any of it can be replaced by
 * declaring your own: the serialisation, the encryption, or the data source itself.
