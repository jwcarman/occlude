 * application takes an {@code AccessContext} parameter. Identity is known at the edge and needed at
 * the gate several layers down, and threading it through everything in between is how a safety
 * feature becomes the most annoying thing in a codebase.
 *
 * <p>Headers here because the example has no identity provider. A real service would read {@code
