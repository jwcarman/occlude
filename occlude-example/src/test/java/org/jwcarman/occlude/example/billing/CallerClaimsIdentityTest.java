   * Spring's container is a lookup-by-type service, so publishing a portal as a bean would hand one
   * to any class willing to name the type in its constructor. That is obtaining authority by naming
   * it, which is the thing this design removed. Portals are private fields of the services entitled
   * to them, and nothing can ask the context for one.
   *
   * <p>The charter, unlike everything else, <b>is</b> published -- and that is the one deliberate
   * concession in the arrangement.
   *
   * <p>Declaring a portal means holding a charter, so it has to be reachable by whatever declares
   * one. Anything holding it can declare a portal at any label and any ceiling. What that buys is
   * that the application never orchestrates the lifecycle, and what it costs is that "who can grant
   * authority" is a grep for this type rather than one file.
   *
   * <p>This application does not create it. It says what its axes are and the starter constructs
   * the charter from them, which is why nothing here has to remember to seal anything.
   *
   * <p><b>What this does not yet close:</b> a published charter still carries {@code seal} and
   * {@code erase}, so any bean willing to name the type can reach them. Moving construction was
   * necessary for that and is not sufficient -- the authority to seal has to become something held
   * rather than something on the type everybody is handed.
