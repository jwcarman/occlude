   * Spring's container is a lookup-by-type service, so publishing a portal as a bean would hand one
   * to any class willing to name the type in its constructor. That is obtaining authority by naming
   * it, which is the thing this design removed. Portals are private fields of the services entitled
   * to them, and nothing can ask the context for one.
   *
   * <p>The charter, unlike everything else, <b>is</b> published -- and that is the one deliberate
   * concession in the arrangement.
   *
   * <p>Declaring a portal means holding a charter, so it has to be reachable by whatever declares
   * one. Anything holding it can declare a portal at any label and any ceiling. What that buys is
   * that the application never orchestrates the lifecycle, and what it costs is that "who can grant
   * authority" is a grep for this type rather than one file.
   *
   * <p>This application does not create it. It says what its axes are and the starter constructs
   * the charter from them, which is why nothing here has to remember to bind anything.
   *
   * <p>The published type carries neither {@code bind} nor {@code erase}: bringing a charter into
   * force stays with the starter, and erasing takes an {@code Erasure} somebody declared and handed
   * over. What remains is a cast to the implementation, which is a statement of intent a reviewer
   * can see rather than something this can prevent.
